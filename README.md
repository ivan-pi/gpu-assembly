## Building

The host library (node set, renumbering, curve keys) and its tests build
with any C++20/Fortran toolchain:

```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build
```

The CUDA parts (cuSolverDx assembly kernels, CUDA Fortran demo) are
opt-in and need the NVHPC toolchain plus MathDx:

```
cmake -B build -DGPU_ASSEMBLY_ENABLE_CUDA=ON \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=nvc++ -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=nvfortran
```

Export the MathDx path:

```
export MATHDX_ROOT=$HOME/nvidia-mathdx-26.06.1-cuda13/nvidia/mathdx/26.06/
```

The file formats the library reads and writes are described in
[docs/file_formats.md](docs/file_formats.md). The analytic periodic
flow fields in `examples/`, meant for verifying a lattice Boltzmann
implementation, are described in
[docs/periodic_benchmarks.md](docs/periodic_benchmarks.md).
